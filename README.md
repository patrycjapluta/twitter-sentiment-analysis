# Twitter-sentiment-analysis
The project has two parts in which I worked on sentiment analysis based on data from Twitter and it's results of my participation in the Hacking Carrots Workshop concerning Data Science.
In the first part (*sentimentAnalysis.ipynb*)I generated tokens to access TwitterAPI and obtain tweets about Artificial Intelligence. Further I collected data into dictionaries and transform into DataFrame, which was cleaned and sentiment was calucaleted and results was visualized.

# How to run
- install dependencies from Pipfile,
- have an account on Twitter Developers, 
- open notebook by Jupyter or Google Colab.

# What did I learn
*I part*
- how to work with TwitterAPI,
- practical use of regular expressions,
- conduct simple sentiment analysis,

*II part*
- words vectorization (bag of words and GloVe),
- train logistic regression model and interpret results,
- train simple neural network.
